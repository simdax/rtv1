Things still left to do:

> Fix configure and installation process. ldconfig by default does not have /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib in the path,
so libwebsock ends up not getting linked to properly. This problem appears to be on Linux.

> Build libevent integration to allow user to specify their own event base for easier integration.

> Build streaming functionalities and fragmented data streams functions. (video / voice streaming?)

> Allow option for setting max frame payload length to be accepted (i.e. correct overflow in libwebsock_handle_recv)

> Add API call to terminate the websocket session
